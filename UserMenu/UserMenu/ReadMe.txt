Add Package Source if its missing in visual Studio -> https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json (you can name it whatever you want but most people use "nuget.org")

To run the program in the command line use : UserMenu users.txt menus.txt > output1.json
If like me when you open up the command line it opens up a terminal instance whice uses powershell then use the following command to run the application : .\UserMenu users.txt menus.txt > output1.json
